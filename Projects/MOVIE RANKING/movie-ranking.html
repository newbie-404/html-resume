<h1>THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER WATCHED</h1>
 <h2>By: E.D.P. Kristiningrum</h2>

 <h3>Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2</h3>
  <p>
    These are the best movies and my favorite all the time. I was 9 y.o or even younger, and keep watching that every Christmas until now. It's not Christmas when you skip it.

 <h3>Richie Rich</h3>
  <p>
    Another MaCaulay Culkin's movie. Made me imagine maybe there is a chance to be as rich as him. Or maybe I could get a freaking rich friend.

 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
  <p>
    The Prisoner of Azkaban is. The characters are growing up, the story is getting darker, and the magic is getting more intense. I love it!
